> Get quickstarted on interactive maps using the open Boston City geospatial data.

## Background

[Boston City open data](https://data.boston.gov/) offers resources that can help us understand the scope of specific issues. 
Geospatial data can become key to many analyses. It is good not only for analysis but also for being illustrated on maps. 
We can take advantage of modern day webpage options for interactivity to create tools by which users can explore the mapped data interactively.

The pieces of software in this repository show us how we can use python on jupyter notebooks to:
- Load a geojson file and plot it.
- Upload a geojson file to a Mapbox Studio account.

This repository also includes an HTML template that:
- Shows a Mapbox Studio layer, and add interactivity to display information about an area when we hover on it.

The html files are **interactive maps** that can be opened **as an ordinary webpage** and they will display a map with interactivity for learning details about the areas.
